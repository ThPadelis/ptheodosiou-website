While the end of the year is around the corner, I was reading some articles on the website, when I discovered an article from Pachi that she was describing her year and I found it a great motive to write an article about my year too.

It may sound a bit self-aggrandizing, but I believe it's essential to take a look at what you have achieved the past year and set new goals for the next year.

## Graduation

This year was the best one in terms of educating that I've ever had. I finally graduate after 4.5 years of studying Computer Science at the University of Thessaly ( previous Technological Educational Institute of Thessaly ). It was an eight semesters study (4 yrs), but in November of 2018, I joined the Greek army, and my studies went back for about a half year. I had my practice in March of 2018 till August of 2018, but I mention it on my 2019 review, cause without the training I wouldn't be able to graduate.

## Wrote some articles

A goal that was on my todo list from July, is finally accomplished, in some way :laughing:. I had a goal to publish at least 10 articles until the end of the year. I failed to publish that many articles ( yes, the number 10 is a big one for me when it's about writing 10 articles. ) but I managed to write half of them. So, I consider this a win for me.
Note to me: Start writing more articles.

## July was a beast

July was the MVP of the year :smile:. In July, I discharged from the Greek army and in the same week, I had the graduation day. As I mentioned before in this month I set some goals that I had to achieve until the end of the year. One of these was to start writing articles. One other was to read books. I managed to read two books. The name of the first one is *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F_ck* and the other's one is *Games People Play*.

## Job

Something else that needs to be noted down for 2019, is that I got my first job interview. I sent a couple of CVs but I got a reply from two IT companies, which I scheduled an interview for both of them. The job for the A company was for a Web Developer and for the B company was for a Junior Web Developer specified on building web sites with CMS ( WordPress and Drupal ). It was a tricky and fun process which I kinda liked it. I finally got a job offer from both companies I had interviewed and I'm glad to announce to you that I'm now working as a Web Developer for the A company.

## Setting new goals

Setting goals is not about writing unrealistic wishes about what you want for yourself, it is about challenging yourself to achieve more! So, start thinking about what you want. Find what makes you happy and go for it!
